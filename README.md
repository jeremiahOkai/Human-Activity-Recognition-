Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and Energy expenditure (EE) are activefield of research in machine learning. Due to the recent advancement in tech-nology,  more  accelerometer  sensor  devices  are  used  to  collect  informationthat  can  be  used  to  train  models  for  HAR  and  prediction  of  EE.  Trainingmodels for HAR and EE is a very challenging task because multiple activitiesare being performed by different people at a different pace and in differentenvironments.  In this research, we studied a novel approach used in build-ing robust and highly accurate deep neural network models for HAR andprediction of EE. We used Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Re-current Unit (GRU) approaches for building these models. The datasets usedto train these models were provided by the Leiden University Medical Cen-ter (LUMC). This study involved 35 participants performing 16 sedentary,ambulatory and lifestyle activities in a semi-structured environment. The re-sults obtained from the models built are competitive with the state of the artapproaches.
